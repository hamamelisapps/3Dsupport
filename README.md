Dimensiva is the worlds first social 3D camera app! It is built to create, share and watch 3D photos from users all over the world.

Creating stunning 3D photos was never easier: Just take two photos and move your iPhone about the distance of your eyes between capturing - then watch your photo with parallel view technique, red-cyan glasses or simply transfer it to your 3D TV!

Taking two shifted images is simple: Just snap one photo and then move your iPhone to the right and take the second one! Only one thing is important: Try to maintain the height of the objects in the photo, otherwise the 3D effect will not work. Please watch the tutorial video.

We‘re constantly improving compatibility for supporting different 3D TVs and photos from 3D cameras. If you have any trouble concerning this compatibility issue, please eMail us right through the app! 

==================================================================
Using the parallel view technique requires some time for training. Don‘t squint! Please watch the tutorial video. Best practice: Look in the distance and while holding the focus, get the iPhone into your field of view. Then you eventually see three images - concentrate on the middle and after some attempts you will see a 3D photo! Once done, it‘ll work fast and well by practice...
